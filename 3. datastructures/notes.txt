Slices are functionally the same as arrays in other languages. They are used to store 
one or more elements with a defined order. The only difference about slices in Go is that
they must be declared with a type. Only elements of that type are eligible to be stored
within that slice.

Maps are the same as hashtables/dictionaries in other languages. They are typically used
to store data in key-value format. Just like with slices, both the key and value types of
a map must be declared.

Extra notes for learning:
- (Slices, under the hood, are actually wrappers around arrays. For more information.
  please refer to the "Resources" section on the blog post about slices vs. arrays!!)
- By design, map iteration is random.
